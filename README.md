# delayed-entry-methods
Simulations related to methods for delayed entry in survival analysis.

Some of the data generation methods here are inspired by Kehl (2023), https://github.com/prissmmnlp/informative_entry_sims, with only modifications to make the code follow the functional paradigm more strictly.
